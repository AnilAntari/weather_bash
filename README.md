# weather_bash
a simple bash script that fetches a weather report for your location right into your terminal
-------------------------------------------------
this is just a simple script for myself to get the current weather right in terminal,\
but feel free to use it as you like, as it is licensed with GNU GPL v.3.0.\
a considerable amount of uwu is present
-------------------------------------------------
to-do:

v.0.2 ----- OUTDATED\
#colorcode the output --- DONE\
#automatic detection of packet manager to install jq(at least apt/pacman/xbps/etc..) --- DONE(semi-auto preferred)\
#uwufy everything --- DONE(though it's a constant process)

v.0.3 ----- OUTDATED\
#add 24-hour forecast as an option --- DONE\
#add ANSI/ASCII art as icons for weather descriptions(not sure yet) --- DISCARDED\
#CLI overhaul for new features --- DONE

v.1.0(initial release) ----- OUTDATED\
#fix the forecast showing past time data --- DONE\
#strong wind alert --- DONE\
#code cleaning --- DONE

v.1.1 ----- CURRENT\
#temperature alert --- DONE\
#minor additions --- DONE

further updates will be most likely only to fix something, i think this project is now complete\
if you may experience any issue with this script or want to suggest to add something - you are more than welcome!

P.S: api keys are intentionally left right in the script as variables so you can change them to your own/any other if they reach the request limit
all of them are registered on a disposable email address, neither i save the passwords to them, so i don't have access to the information sent through them at all
